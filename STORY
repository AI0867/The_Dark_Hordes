Writing up a rought draft of the storyline here.

Setting: around 800 YW, currently placed in the northwestern parts in and out
 of wesnoth.

Crelanu's Book is introduced by Legend of Wesmere, given to Delfador in 
Delfador's Memoirs, where it is hinted Asheviere took it for a while.
The storytxt of "Crelanu's Book" implies that Ravanal turned to evil after
perusing the book.

Scenario 9 (Underground River) outline:
-During the scenario, the cave gets re-flooded by magical means. (drowning!)
-Naga swim around in the water, trying to claim the cave.
-The dwarves that haven't run from the floods yet have no intention of leaving.
-Plenty of other annoying things.

At some point, Gwiti retrieves the other half of the Skull of Morgorath,
 whether he is then revived or it becomes an artifact of great power is yet to
be decided.


Gwiti's death (possible end of the campaign): by the hands of Elynia,
 who later becomes the lady of light.
At the start of the scenario, Elynia says that one of the two must die there.
Gwiti replies that one will indeed die, and the other will live forever.

When Elynia kills Gwiti, (how to write that into this campaign I don't know)
 he stays true to his word and curses Elynia:
    to live until no living things remain

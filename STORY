Writing up a rought draft of the storyline here.

Setting: around 800 YW, currently placed in the northwestern parts in and out
 of wesnoth.


Scenario 9 outline:
-During the scenario, the cave gets re-flooded by magical means. (drowning!)
-Naga swim around in the water.
-Plenty of other annoying things.

At some point, Gwiti retrieves the other half of the Skull of Agarash,
 whether he is then revived or it becomes an artifact of great power is yet to
be decided.


Gwiti's death (possible end of the campaign): by the hands of Elynia,
 who later becomes the lady of light.
At the start of the scenario, Elynia says that one of the two must die there.
Gwiti replies that one will indeed die, and the other will live forever.

When Elynia kills Gwiti, (how to write that into this campaign I don't know)
 he stays true to his word and curses Elynia:
    to live until no living things remain

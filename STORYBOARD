Scenario 10
Name: Return to the Northlands
Story:
[legends_of_the_north.ogg] The orcs and undead easily defended the cave
stronghold and when the water subsided, the nagas were driven off or slain,
their magical artifact exhausted.
[northerners.ogg] Months later, Gwiti finished studying the Tome of Crelanu and
departed for where he believed the other half of Morgorath's skull to be. The
orcs, restless without an enemy to fight, eagerly followed.

Scenario:
music: northerners.ogg, vengeful.ogg the_dangerous_symphony.ogg
Side 1 (human/undead): Gwiti
Side 2 (human/orc): Tanar
Side 3 (ai/orc): Vrork

Gwiti can now recruit Ghouls
Tanar can now recruit Wolf Riders

Start dialogue:
Vrork> Which cave-orc dares to trespass on my land?
Tanar> I am Tanar. My clan and I seek passage to the north, by force if need be.
Vrork> I am the great Vrork! No weakling cave-orc will pass through my lands!
Slay them, my grunts!
Tanar> My brethren, the enemy we have been yearning to fight has arrived!
Gwiti> It seems I'll have dead orcs marching with me as well as living ones. He,
he he...

Dialogue on first ghoul recruit:
Gwiti> Crelanu certainly knew some interesting magic!

Dialogue on Gwiti's last breath:
What? I can't die! Noooo!
defeat

Dialogue on Tanar's last breath:
Tanar> Avenge me, my brethren! We have been betrayed!
a unit is selected as Tanar's second, is given leadership crown (What happens
 if there are none? Nothing I guess)
Second> I never liked those undead anyway!
side 2 is now ai-controlled and on its own team, hostile to side 1

Dialogue on Vrork's last breath:
Vrork> No cave-orc can kill me! I am the might Vro...
Vrork dies w/ animation.
Killer|undead> I am no orc!
Killer|orc> I didn't know surface orcs were this fragile.
If more than 3 enemy orcs left:
...
trigger next event when enough of them killed.

If at most 3 orcs left on side 3:
enemy orc is selected from all hostile orcs
enemy orc> We are getting slaughtered! Run for your lives!
Gwiti> Let them run! All shall fear me!

If Tanar's side is hostile and still alive at this point, they leave.
Same if the second-in-command is killed.

TODO: What happens on timeout?

Scenario 11
Name: An Orcish Coup
Story:
[northerners.ogg] Gwiti's research directed him north, further into the orcish
lands.
Eventually, he could sense the presence of the skull's other half. The feeling
led him to what appeared to be an orcish capital.

Scenario:
Side 1 (human/undead): Gwiti
Side 2 (human/orc): Tanar, if he's alive
Side 3 (ai/orc): Kogran
Side 4 (ai/orc): Eradush
Side 5 (ai/orc): Prirag

The scenario starts at first watch.

Start dialogue:
Gwiti> One of those three warlords has the skull, though I can't tell which.
w/ Tanar:
    Tanar> It is a large host they have gathered here. It would be wise to
avoid fighting them head on, even if they haven't united under one banner.
    Gwiti> I may have a way to assassinate the leaders, but we will need to
draw away their forces...
w/o Tanar:
    Gwiti> And the army they command is huge; I haven't seen such a mass of
orcs since Erzen. There should be easier way to get to the skull, let's see
what Crelanu wrote...
    Gwiti> Ah, yes, invisibility it was. I'm not sure if my dear brother
qualifies as a lich though...
Gwiti summons Nati the Nightgaunt
Gwiti> Hello brother, you will be serving as ingredients today.
...

NOTE: see DM
NOTE2: yes, apparently Gwiti carried Nati's skull with him all this time

On Nati's last breath:
Gwiti> Go back to the shades, you incompetent fool!

On first dawn (third turn):
Gwiti> Dear brother, would you be so kind to explain to me why I am visible?
Nati> The light weakens me, the magic should resume at dusk.
Gwiti> Perhaps you aren't as powerful as you had thought. A lich's eyes should
keep me invisible even during the day.

FIXME: Nati seems rather out of character here, though that may be explained
by being bound into servitude.

Scenario 10
Name: Return to the Northlands
Story:
[legends_of_the_north.ogg] The orcs and undead easily defended the cave
stronghold and when the water subsided, the nagas were driven off or slain,
their magical artifact exhausted.
[northerners.ogg] Months later, Gwiti finished studying the Tome of Crelanu and
departed for where he believed the other half of Morgorath's skull to be. The
orcs, restless without an enemy to fight, eagerly followed.

Scenario:
music: northerners.ogg, vengeful.ogg the_dangerous_symphony.ogg
Side 1 (human/undead): Gwiti
Side 2 (human/orc): Tanar
Side 3 (ai/orc): Vrork

Start dialogue:
Vrork> Which cave-orc dares to trespass on my land?
Tanar> I am Tanar. My clan and I seek passage to the north, by force if need be.
Vrork> I am the great Vrork! No weakling cave-orc will pass through my lands!
Slay them, my grunts!
Tanar> My brethren, the enemy we have been yearning to fight has arrived!
Gwiti> It seems I'll have dead orcs marching with me as well as living ones. He,
he he...

Dialogue on first ghoul recruit:
Gwiti> Crelanu certainly knew some interesting magic!

Dialogue on Gwiti's last breath:
What? I can't die! Noooo!
defeat

Dialogue on Tanar's last breath:
Tanar> Avenge me, my brethren! We have been betrayed!
a unit is selected as Tanar's second, is given leadership crown (FIXME: what happens if there are none?)
Second> I never liked those undead anyway!
side 2 is now ai-controlled and on its own team, hostile to side 1

Dialogue on Vrork's last breath:
Vrork> No cave-orc can kill me! I am the might Vro...
Vrork dies w/ animation.
Killer|undead> I am no orc!
Killer|orc> I didn't know surface orcs were this fragile.
If more than 3 enemy orcs left:
...
trigger next event when enough of them killed.

If at most 3 orcs left on side 3:
enemy orc is selected from all hostile orcs
enemy orc> We are getting slaughtered! Run for your lives!
Gwiti> Let them run! All shall fear me!

If Tanar's side is hostile and still alive at this point, they leave.
Same if the second-in-command is killed.
